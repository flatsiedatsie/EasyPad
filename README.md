EasyPad
=======

real-time collaborative editor (RTCE)

EasyPad helps to make notices for your projects and to share them with others.

For every project create a new EasyPad page. You get an unique URL which you can save into your bookmarks or send to others to collaborate.

- Everyone who knows this URL can see and edit the page.  
- Use the well-known markdown-syntax to format your texts.  
- Upload files and images
- no need for a database. Everything is stored into the filesystem.
