EasyPad
=======

real-time collaborative editor (RTCE)

EasyPad helps to make notices for your projects and to share them with others.

For every project create a new EasyPad page. You get an unique URL which you can save into your bookmarks or send to others to collaborate.

Everyone who knows this URL can see and edit the page.
